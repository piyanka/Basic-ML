# Machine Learning Models Repository

This repository contains various machine learning models implemented in Python. The goal of this repository is to provide a collection of basic machine learning models for educational and research purposes.

## Models
The repository contains the following machine learning models:

Linear Regression,
Logistic Regression,
K-Nearest Neighbors,
Decision Trees,
Random Forest,
Support Vector Machines,
Neural Network,
Naive Bayes,
K-Means Clustering

Each model is implemented in its own Jupyter notebook and is well commented to aid understanding.
